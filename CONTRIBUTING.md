# Contributing into llamadart

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `llamadart`! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve this package.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Dart SDK**: >= 3.10.7
-   **Flutter SDK**: >= 3.38.0 (optional, for running UI examples)
-   **CMake**: >= 3.10
-   **C++ Compiler**:
    -   **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
    -   **Linux**: GCC/G++ (`build-essential`) or Clang
    -   **Windows**: Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop development with C++). 
        -   *Tip*: Install `ccache` or `sccache` via `choco install sccache` to speed up local builds.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular, decoupled architecture:

-   `lib/src/core/engine/`: Core orchestration (`LlamaEngine`, `ChatSession`).
-   `lib/src/core/template/`: Chat template routing, handlers, parser logic.
-   `lib/src/backends/`: Platform-agnostic backend interface and native/web backends.
-   `lib/src/core/models/`: Shared data models (messages, params, tools, config).
-   `lib/src/core/`: Shared utilities (exceptions, logger, grammar helpers).

## 🛡️ Zero-Patch Strategy

Native source and build orchestration now live in
[`leehack/llamadart-native`](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart-native).

*   **Zero Direct Modifications**: Do not patch upstream `llama.cpp` sources in this repository.
*   **Sync-Only in this repo**: This repository consumes released native bundles and generated bindings.
*   **Build logic lives elsewhere**: Native build scripts and backend matrix changes belong in `llamadart-native`.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Native Assets & CI

`llamadart` uses a modern binary distribution lifecycle:

### 1. Binary Production (CI)
Native binaries are built and released from
[`leehack/llamadart-native`](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart-native).
That repository publishes multi-library native bundles for
**Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows**.

### 1b. Web Bridge Asset Production (CI)
Web bridge source/build and published runtime assets are managed in:

- [`leehack/llama-web-bridge`](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge)
- [`leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets`](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets)

`llamadart` consumes pinned bridge assets from `llama-web-bridge-assets`
for `example/chat_app` and web backend testing via
`scripts/fetch_webgpu_bridge_assets.sh`.

### 2. Binary Consumption (Hook)
When a user adds `llamadart` as a dependency and runs their app:
- The **`hook/build.dart`** script executes automatically.
- It detects the user's current target OS and architecture.
- It downloads the matching pre-compiled native bundle from
  `leehack/llamadart-native` GitHub Releases.
- It reports the required shared libraries to the Dart VM as `CodeAsset`s,
  including `package:llamadart/llamadart`.

### 3. Runtime Resolution (FFI)
- The library uses **`@Native`** top-level bindings in `lib/src/backends/llama_cpp/bindings.dart`.
- The Dart VM automatically resolves these calls to the downloaded binary reported by the hook.
- This provides a "Zero-Setup" experience while maintaining high-performance native execution.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leehack/llamadart.git
    cd llamadart
    ```

2.  **Initialize**:
    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```

3.  **Build/Fetch Native Library**:
    In most cases, simply running the examples will handle everything:
    ```bash
    cd example/basic_app
    dart run
    ```
    The `hook/build.dart` will automatically download the correct pre-compiled binaries for your platform.

## Maintainer Workspace Conventions (Multi-Repo)

Maintainers often keep related repositories as siblings one level above
`llamadart`:

```text
../llamadart
../llamadart-native
../llama-web-bridge
../llama-web-bridge-assets
```

This is a convenience convention, not a hard requirement.
Always verify paths in your environment before using them.

- If changing native runtime behavior: edit `../llamadart-native`, release there,
  then sync/update `llamadart`.
- If changing web bridge runtime behavior: edit `../llama-web-bridge`,
  publish assets to `../llama-web-bridge-assets`, then update pinned tag/docs
  in `llamadart`.
- Keep ownership boundaries clear: this repo should avoid direct upstream
  source patching for native/web runtime internals.

## 🧪 Testing

We take testing seriously. CI enforces **>=70% line coverage on maintainable `lib/` code**. Auto-generated files are excluded when they are marked with `// coverage:ignore-file`.

### 1. Unified Test Runner
We use `dart_test.yaml` and `@TestOn` tags to manage multi-platform execution.
Running `dart test` will run VM and Chrome-compatible tests. Tests tagged
`local-only` are intentionally skipped in default and CI runs.

```bash
# Run default suite (VM + Chrome-compatible tests)
dart test

# Run local-only E2E tests
dart test --run-skipped -t local-only
```

### 2. Manual Platform Selection
You can still target specific platforms if needed:

```bash
# Run only VM tests
dart test -p vm

# Run only Chrome tests
dart test -p chrome
```

### 3. Coverage
To collect and view coverage reports:

```bash
# 1. Run VM tests with coverage
dart test -p vm --coverage=coverage

# 2. Format into LCOV (respects // coverage:ignore-file)
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage/test --out=coverage/lcov.info --report-on=lib --check-ignore

# 3. Enforce >=70% threshold
dart run tool/testing/check_lcov_threshold.dart coverage/lcov.info 70
```

### 4. Testing Standards
- **Structure**:
  - Unit tests live in `test/unit/` and mirror `lib/src/` paths.
  - Generated/native-bridge files are excluded from strict mirroring when marked with `// coverage:ignore-file`.
  - Scenario, regression, and diagnostic tests live in `test/integration/`.
  - Slow, local-machine scenarios live in `test/e2e/` with `@Tags(['local-only'])`.
- **Refactoring**: If you refactor shared logic, ensure both Native and Web tests pass.
- **New Features**: Every new public API or feature must include unit or integration tests.
- **Platform-Safety**: `LlamaEngine` must remain `dart:ffi` and `dart:io` free to maintain web support.

## Maintainer: Building Binaries

If you need to build binaries for a new release:

1.  Use the native build repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leehack/llamadart-native.git
    cd llamadart-native
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2.  Build/release with the native pipeline:
    - Run `Native Build & Release` in `llamadart-native` (`.github/workflows/native_release.yml`), or
    - Build locally via `python3 tools/build.py ...` as documented in that repository.

3.  Sync `llamadart` hook pin:
    - Run `Sync Native Version & Bindings`
      (`.github/workflows/sync_native_bindings.yml`) in this repository to:
      - resolve a `llamadart-native` release tag,
      - sync headers from the matching release header bundle,
      - regenerate Dart bindings from the matching native headers,
      - open an automated PR with the updates.
    - For local regeneration, run:
      ```bash
      tool/native/sync_native_headers_and_bindings.sh --tag latest
      ```

## Running Examples

### Basic App (CLI)
1.  ```bash
    cd example/basic_app
    dart run
    ```

### Chat App (Flutter)
1.  ```bash
    cd example/chat_app
    flutter run -d macos  # or linux, windows, android, ios
    ```

## Development Guidelines

-   **Code Style**: We follow standard Dart linting rules. Run `dart format .` before committing.
-   **Native Assets**: The package uses the modern **Dart Native Assets** (hooks) mechanism.
-   **Testing**: Add unit tests for new features where possible. Use `dart test` for full integration and unit verification.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request.

All PRs should complete the checklist in
`.github/pull_request_template.md`, including:

- Cross-platform safety checks (no accidental `dart:io`/`dart:ffi` in
  shared/web-reachable paths).
- Explicit unsupported behavior handling via `LlamaUnsupportedException`
  where appropriate.
- Required validation commands:
  - `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .`
  - `dart analyze`
  - `dart test -p vm -j 1 --exclude-tags local-only`
  - `dart test -p chrome --exclude-tags local-only`

CI runs these checks and merge should be blocked until all required jobs pass.

Thank you for contributing!
